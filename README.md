# Sports Collection Website

This project is a simple static website created during my college time.  
The website is focused on showcasing different sports collections and was built using **HTML** and **CSS**.  

Additionally, the project contains a separate folder where I experimented with some **JavaScript assignments** to practice and learn basic scripting concepts.

## Features
